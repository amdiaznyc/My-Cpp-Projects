// Section 5.4
// Examples Using the 'for' Statement

// The following examples show methods of varying the control variable
// in a 'for' statement. In each case, we write the appropiate 'for'
// statement header. Note the change in the relational operator
// for loops that decrement the control variable.

// a) Vary the control variable from 1 to 100 in increments of 1.
    for ( int i = 1; i <= 100; i++ )

// b) Vary the control variable from 100 down to 1 in decrements of 1.
    for ( int i = 100; i >= 1; i-- )

// c) Vary the control variable from 7 to 77 in steps of 7.
    for ( int i = 7; i <= 77; i += 7 )

// d) Vary the control variable from 20 down to 2 in steps of -2.
    for ( int i = 20; i >= 2; i -= 2 )

// e) Vary the control variable over the following sequences of values: 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17.
    for ( int i = 2; i <= 17; i += 3 )

// f) Vary the control variable over the following sequences of values: 99, 88, 77, 66, 55.
    for ( int i = 99; i >= 55; i -= 11 )
